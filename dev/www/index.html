                    <p>iParade is a locative multimedia experience. To participate
                        in this journey, you will walk to several nearby locations to
                        access uploaded segments that are linked to each particular
                        location.</p>
                    <p>
                        The MAP tab <img class='instructions' src='img/map2.jpg' />
                        will show your current location and the locations you need to visit
                        to complete the journey. The next place you need to visit will be
                        shown with a green marker <img class='instructions'
                            src='img/targetLocation_next.png' />. The map will re-center
                        on your current location each time you go the map tab.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To see the introduction page (and other content), visit the HOME
                        tab <img class='instructions' src='img/home.jpg' />. After you
                        read the introduction page tap the NEXT button <img
                            class='instructions' src='img/next_arrow.jpg' />.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The HOME tab <img class='instructions' src='img/home.jpg' /> is
                        where you can read the text and see the video for each location.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After you finish reading the text press the PLAY button <img
                            class='instructions' src='img/play.jpg' />. This button will
                        appear once the video is fully loaded. Until that time you will see
                        a LOADING animation <img class='instructions'
                            src='img/downloading.gif' />.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the video is finished playing you will need to tap “done” in
                        your media player (on some devices) and then NEXT <img
                            class='instructions' src='img/next_arrow.jpg' /> to continue.
                        Then, go to the next location that is marked in green <img
                            class='instructions' src='img/targetLocation_next.png' /> in
                        your MAP tab <img class='instructions' src='img/map2.jpg' />
                        and continue to view content and visit sites until the last
                        location.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You have the option to repeat/reload one step <img
                            class='instructions' src='img/reload_page.jpg' /> or the
                        entire App <img class='instructions' src='img/repeat.jpg' />.
                        You may need to reload <img class='instructions'
                            src='img/reload_page.jpg' /> a step, if the LOADING animation
                        <img class='instructions' src='img/downloading.gif' />
                        continues to show for a very long time and the PLAY button <img
                            class='instructions' src='img/play.jpg' /> never appears.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the SETTINGS tab <img class='instructions'
                            src='img/setting.jpg' /> you can turn the voice-over off or on
                        by tapping the SOUND button <img class='instructions'
                            src='img/voice_over_on.jpg' />. The two repeat/reload buttons:
                        one step <img class='instructions' src='img/reload_page.jpg' />
                        or the entire App <img class='instructions' src='img/repeat.jpg' />,
                        are also available in the SETTINGS tab <img class='instructions'
                            src='img/setting.jpg' />.
                    </p>
                    <p>On some devices you can hit the BACK button to quit the app.</p>

                        iParade is a series of locative media-works, created by <a target="_blank"
                            href="http://www.lovid.org/">LoVid</a> as smart-phone Apps.
                        iParade uses GPS data and includes video, sound, and texts that are
                        accessible only in specific geographic locations. The content is
                        inspired by, and recorded in the same locations, such as a street,
                        a building, or a city park. To watch the work in full, visitors
                        need to physically relocate themselves to access uploaded segments
                        that are linked to each particular location. iParade renews
                        viewers’ appreciation of their physical environment by providing a
                        unique perspective into narratives and abstractions of public
                        spaces.
