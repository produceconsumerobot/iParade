<p>Hannah.</p>

<p>The house is saturated with simulations, augmented beverages, and digitally
placed d&eacute;cor.</p>

<p>She looks out the window. Her data and nutrient plan has been adjusted to
meet her needs and her means. She cannot go anywhere because the presets were
calculated to sustain her in one place.</p>

<p>But today she is consumed with boredom. And something at the window catches
her eye. A band of people, looking at the house. Not the house, the place where
the house stands.</p>

<p>She can sense the space, the air between her and the wall, the wall's surface
echoes in the room.</p>

<p>Her shirt, she remembers, is a simulation tool too.</p>

<p>The kind that enhances tangible prompts of a fireplace or linen.</p>

<p>Functionality supplemented by design.</p>

<p>In a moment of inspiration and disparity she cuts into it: the threads and
electrofibers. She will embellish her work with buttons, fabric scraps, and an
interface.</p>

<p>There is meaning in mythology, and the builders have calculated that
variable. A mythological story of disembodiment retold.</p>
