<p>The builders visit the hackshop.</p>

<p>They have materials and purpose, schematics and memory chips.</p>

<p>Their firmware is regulated and, for efficiency, they have, until recently,
subscribed to a direct upgrade plan.</p>

<p>But they must learn how to subvert the infrastructure, redirect outputs,
extend and split the feed.</p>

<p>They come prepared with downloaded and printed plugs, beta versions of
NeuroWare, which arrived with promotional stickers in semi-translucent aluminum
bags.</p>

<p>A historian greets them at the doors with a reassuring voice.</p>

<p>The historian’s hands collect artifacts. Not merely the objects themselves
but the occasions in which they were held.</p>

<p>She thinks about how but she does not ask why.</p>

<p>The Hackshop was built by a man and his son, and now is operated by a man and
his father.</p>

<p>Over the years, the two men have held various positions in the Hackshop:
inventors, mechanics, and archivists.</p>

<p>The historian makes herself useful in the work of preservation and
presentation:</p>

<p>"...they used to...and then it would...was put this way...and then they
turned..."</p>

<p>The machines work but production is halted.</p>

<p>"We are in the business of synthesizing sounds and smells. Our work is the
theater of manufacturing, our workers’-hands and our stained shirts."</p>

<p>She has many recording devices at her desk:</p>

<p>Paper, pen, measuring tape, Polaroid camera, Dictaphone, T-square, abacus,
calculator... Her interviews will assist in fabrication of their custom electric
extensions.</p>
