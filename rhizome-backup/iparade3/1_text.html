<p>People are taking measures to locate the house that moves.</p>

<p>They stop responding to personalized audiovisual prompts:</p>

<p>"There are many opportunities for sight-seeing and supporting local business
in this neighborhood. Based on your dinner selection from yesterday, you may
want to stop at the Tailless Ox for a bite."</p>

<p>They quickly realize how to overcome the prompts. If they do not input their
desires  or satisfactions, there will be no data. As long as they remain
transparent, blank to  the system, they can continue doing their labor
uninterrupted.</p>

<p>And so, they become a band of builders and remodelers. They need to avoid
concrete thinking, so they build concrete things.</p>

<p>They come to the house to collect materials for NanoMem storage units.
Materials  marked by time and lived experiences of the house’s tenants. They
reach into corners of rusted, dusted and neglected parts. Collecting traces of
functionality, of daily chores, of the systems that made this place.</p>

<p>A former tenant comes along.</p>

<p>He, the boy (young), now man (old), remembers the bricked path where photos
were taken, always outside.</p>

<p>They question him, watching his years layered in no particular order. Mapping
the grid of his behavior across the house’s floor plan, they record the times
his hands touched the banister.</p>

<p>In between blinding bright and engulfing dark, memory and forgetfulness, are
patterned wallpaper marks that made a home.</p>
