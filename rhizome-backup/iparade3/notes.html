<p>The film clips included in this work are excerpts from 1940s-1950s student work from City College’s Film Technique Department.</p>
<p>* Hamilton Grange was the home of Alexander Hamilton, the first US Secretary of the Treasury. The house was built in 1802, two years before Hamilton was killed in a duel with political rival Aaron Burr, in Weehawken, NJ. In 1889 the house was moved from its original location, near West 143rd Street, to Convent Avenue. It stayed there, between St. Luke’s Episcopal Church and an apartment building, for over a century. In 2008, the house was relocated for the second time, to St. Nicholas Park. The house was subsequently restored and renovated and has been open to the public since Fall 2011.</p>
<p>*From 1942-1956, Hans Richter taught and was the supervisor of the Institute of Film Technique at City College New York. Excerpts from his students’ work are included in Unchanged When Exhumed. Richter believed that all people have a passion for filmmaking; “They are attracted by the magic of the motion picture as an outlet for their creative energies.” Richter envisioned a time when everyone would have “large projections” in their homes and that they would watch films, homemade films. He felt that teaching film was a social responsibility; “If no one helps them make good films, they will make bad ones”. One of his teaching goals was to get his students to observe and understand the problems in society.</p>
<p>*At the centennial celebration (1947) of New York City College, students and faculty of City College buried a time capsule on campus. The time capsule contained documents from the faculty and alumni and a scroll with signatures of students and faculty members. The Time Capsule will be exhumed at the school’s second centennial in 2047.</p>
