<p>The Archives contain photographic documents, localized weather analyses,
employment and crime statistics, traffic alerts, and soil maps.</p>

<p>"Access to a place is a calculated gesture", it says.</p>

<p>A band of people studies the field, memorizing all 360 degrees of images,
seisemic wave frequencies, and the population characteristics of park visitors.</p>

<p>Once in a place, the sonic void and direct sunlight sets them off to work:
building a system from the ground up, architecture of collected experiences.</p>

<p>Bricks were once a sign for economic independence and soil far and wide. Now
they are carefully measuring carbon levels to ensure the resilience and
conductivity of plated bricks for the NanoMem memory units.</p>

<p>At the end of a shift the workers examine their hands. Individual napkins
with fine hairs accumulate the smallest, most precious of molecules. Powdered
red stains of rust in the grooves of the hands. Black grease in the fingernails.
Shades of greens and browns.</p>
