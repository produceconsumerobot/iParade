<div class='pageText'>
<p>
You arrived in reading and watching. <br>
You arrived with curiosity and the quest for tools. <br>
Publications were distributed with the promise of employment. <br>
But you came searching for observational appliances and a refined lens.<br>
Others before you wore greenscreens too. In tweed suits, thick-framed eyewear, spotless shaves. <br>
Yearning for transparency, they relocated emotions and carefully-phrased political thoughts onto objects. <br>
Body objects. Externalizing and transferring experiences.</p>
<p>
You came here by touch. With gestures and mechanics they manipulated their cameras. With arched backs and raised shoulders, rotating and tilting in the convexity of their stomachs and the gentle reassuring support of an index finger.</p>
