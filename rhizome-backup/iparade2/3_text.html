Speculation<br>
Walking to the estimated location he anticipated a vastness that will feel like the radius of somewhere familiar.  <br>
Filled with pre-conceived ideas he reached a featureless house smoothed by time.  <br>
The decay of details and of human effort now renders it timeless.  <br>
Thankfully, this will not be hard to erase - null object.</p>
<p>
Even now he could feel the effacement of all his materials: woven glass, copper, calcium, conductive tissues.<br>
The stones, the façade, project emptiness.  <br>
The core of the banister, the deep soil: still void of human intention.</p>
<p>
The space of the house that was here is vast, bigger now in it’s absence.<br>
The screen could accurately illustrate its dimensions with archived documents and restored historical drawings.<br>
Visitors walk around it with data slicing magnifying glasses.<br>
But this  will not assist sensing the scale of the house that moves.</p>
