<h2 class='pageTitle'>Step One</h2>
<div class='pageText'>
<p>People with cameras are circling a tree.<br>
Their eyes don’t squint.<br>
Instead, they sway, arms swift, elbows bent, up and down.<br>
Hands and fingers form an open half rectangle holding: silver, black,<br>
pink, striped encased screens.<br>
To choose an angle, they stagger. Once towards the lowered arm - head tilted, fingers cupping miniature-flattened realities. Rhythmic. <br>
Then, elbow up, they extend the space between the supporting arms and the captured texture.</p>
<p>The players align themselves with parallel visions that have been haunting.<br>
The layer of expectations still hovers, the recorded energy of things-never-been.</p>
