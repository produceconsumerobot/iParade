<p>
The house returned and became visible again. <br>
Neighbors would debate whether or not it was ever carried and if it weighed anything at all. <br>
Because - it might not contain actual mass, just a shredded past.</p>
<p>
A group of people: 19, 23, 44, 68 moved in.<br>
The walls were smoothed and antique-replica desks were placed in corners. <br>
The land they stood on was worthless, emptied. So was the outer shell of the house <br>
that has been subjected to treatment with layers of protection against the elements by ignorant residents. <br>
Inside, they used their skills to harvest decay and modify neurocircuitry: <br>
molding chipped wood with refired floor tile dust, filtering liquids in custom containers around foundations, <br>
and pipes into hyperconductive puddles. They formed new touch interfaces.</p>
<p>
And their hard drives were removable. <br>
The enclosed impenetrable layers of their handhelds were cracked, scarred, and modular. <br>
They would go on experimental walks and exchange points of view, but would hardly talk. <br>
Their language became the pendulum of their arms handing off cued data: I have something to say; this is how I see it.</p>
<p>
And then, Vera had a memory that wasn’t hers.</p>
