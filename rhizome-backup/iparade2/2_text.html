<p>The file management.<br>
Landscape artists are synthesizing forest dampness in the curves of concrete stairways.<br>
The leaves and branches meticulously engraved with plotted centuries.<br>
Memories of sustaining weather in their dark grooves. Memories relocated.</p>
<p>
Vera realized immobility was inconsistent.<br>
Houses move, trees, and now memories<br>
In 1889 they had a house moved and then again in 2008.<br>
Today, for the 5th time a memory she thought was hers was new again.</p>
<p>
I have been updating and backing up daily.<br>
Following the File Management Administrationâ€™s recommended routine maintenance.<br>
Time/Day/Month/Year. Raw neural feed recorded, captured, and classified.</p>
<p>
She lets go of her HandHeld and feels the lightness of transparency and consciousless.</p>
<p>
Vera remembered when intentions were in written words and a time capsule with 73 feet of parchment engorged with meaning.</p>
